## Description

This project functions as a note taking app in order to keep one's thoughts and reminders in one place. This was achieved by connecting front-end starter code to an Express.js back end in order to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

If the user, chooses to create a new note, once they input a note title and a note text, a save icon will appear. Once the user is done creating their note, they can click on the save icon which will populate this new note on the left side bar with the other saved notes.
